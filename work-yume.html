        <h5>Project Overview</h5>
            <p>The YUME Gardens website, while functional, was not designed with the user in mind. In our opinion, the site was text heavy, with little typographic hierarchy, and did not address what we considered the  users priorities: buying tickets, hours & location.
            We wanted to create a website that was not only accessable but beautiful as well.</p>

        <p>A responsive website redesign with emphasis on simplified navigation and user first design.

        <h5>Research</h5>
        <p>We began the redesign by going through the website page by page to really  understand what the organization was about and how they serve the community. Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluations were done.  User surveys were created and posted on social media, and one-on-one user interviews conducted. Our key takeaways:

          <p>Guy wants to maintain his Japanese language ability, deepen his connection to Japanese culture, and reconnect with nature. He finds being outdoors and disconnecting with technology helps with his stress and anxiety. </p>
          <h5>WANTS & NEEDS</h5>

        <p>Conducting usability testing of our prototypes, we  concluded our testers had no problems navigating to the “Donations” page, finding the “Path to Emotional Healing Program” or finding directions to the garden. So far the redesign was as success, except for a few things.

      <p>User Feedback:</p>

        <li>It would be much less confusing to split the "About Us" section from the "Visit Us" page and create a seperate page for it.</li>
        <li>A floating "Register" button on the "Path to Emotional Healing" page would keep the CTA front and center (literally)on a very text heavy page.</li>
        <li>Questions as to why are there seperate "Getting Here & Parking" and Map & Location" pages as they really seem to address the same or similar problems.</li>

            <h6>CONCLUSION</h6>
            <p>Like everything in life, working in a group has its positives and negatives. I loved that we were able crush our 3 week deadline, on the other hand it was a little chaotic as we raced the clock. Communication, like in any working or personal relationship is crucial.</p>

              <p>I feel like we missed mark on a few things however. I believe we got off on the wrong foot by treating the gardens like a tourist attraction rather than a non-profit organization. It took some doing to refocus on the non-profit aspect of the Gardens. 
              Because there were 4 of us all working on the wireframes, the mobile and desktop prototypes have some inconsistencies that should be addressed in the future.</p> 
              
              <p>If this were a real project I would suggest a companion app with an interactive map of the garden, access to a digital version of the “Path to Emotional Healing” Program, or maybe even an audio guided tour of the gardens that changes with the seasons. </p>
              
              <p>All in all it was a great experience, especially in this era of Covid, to work together and collaborate with other aspiring designers. I think we all learned from one another - not just the nuts and bolts of website redesign, but we got to glimpse each other’s work flows and problem solving processes.</p>
